=== Expander thoughts ===

Enable:
	- very quick simple var substitution
	- method substitution, incl. with complex arguments
	- compiling
	- expand sub-templates
	- embed arbitrary JS for loops, etc
	? auto re-substitute values later

Assumptions
	- generally will be loading/parsing many templates from a file all at once
	- templates live in central repository with dotted namespaces (or hope::blah?)
	- you will generally call the expander with your main object as context
		(allows you to get messages, etc)

Characteristics of solution
	- generate optimized function so we can pre-compile
		- how can we know if pre-compiled available?  depend on jammer for that.
	- superset of prototype's templates


Methodology

	- for all in file, create evaluators, then stick together in a JS script tag
	
	- #{...} is (safe) var or fuction substitution
		- may not be safe for function arguments
	
	- <#>...</#> is (unsafe) arbitrary JS embedding
	
	- wrap the entire thing in a try/catch?  
		- only if arbitrary? 
		- test speed


Special functions you can call in expanders:
	- expand(templateid [,newContext])


TODO:
	- verify that we can insert a script tag with expander functions
	- Script should be able to parse/insert ala stylesheet
	-

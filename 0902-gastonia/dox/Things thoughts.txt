Draggable mixin
	- isInDragArea(event)
DragResizable mixin

ExpanderWidget   (?Expandable?  Mixin?)
CanvasWidget

Slider Layout   -- makes target element a filler, adds resize arrows on either side if too big for space
	(rename Spliiter to SplitLayout?  Slideable?)
Scroller layout -- like a slider but custom scrollbars in one or both directions
PartEventHandler 
	-- for widget where you have distinct parts but don't want to create a sub-widget fore each
Toolbar - manages a set of buttons, possibly a sliderlayout
	- buttons can be widgets or parts
Gauge - visual representation of a scalar
Drawable?
Popup mixin
Hoverable mixin
ModalPopup mixin
Dialog
PropertyDialog (remembers old props and saves diffs, etc)
TabContainer (name?  Stack?)
Section
	- header, footer, main
	- auto-layout?
	- can be draggable, etc
	


Settable pattern
	- has "options" object which inherits from super
	- set({}) or set(key,value)  [ do NOT auto-create setters ]
	- get is just options.key
	- auto-remember last values?
	- id and options?  pass id into identify/register?
	- think about getting properties back out for saving	

App semantics (convention over configuration)
	- App, Page, Section concepts  (all are loadable on the fly)
	- in your page, you load /hope/hope.js and /you/appName.js
		- auto-loads /you/appname/page/<pageFileName>.js
	


TODO
	- dependency map visualization
	- mark a class as pre-loaded for page compiler
	- figure out $super() attachment for Mixins and instances
	- whole observe/notify thing?
	- examine a bunch of apps (Zimnbra, gmail, zoho, campfire) for widget ideas and patterns

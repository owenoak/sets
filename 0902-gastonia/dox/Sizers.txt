/*
	INTERESTING:
		- have CSS classes we apply to something to get their min and max?


	Resizer Pattern
		- params:
				- element or element getter (default is $element)
				- layout method (default is "dirtyLayout")
				- edges ("all n s e w ne se nw sw")
							("all -n -s" ?)
				- min/max width & height
				- edge size (default 5 px)
				- preference name
				
		- assumes we call dirtyLayout() to redraw
		- build in splitter concept as well?


	Mover Pattern
		- params:
				- element or element getter
				- titlebar elements
				- vs anywhere in the bg of the element
				- minMovesize
				- offscreen? (eg: can move out of bounds)
				- snap areas
		- (bounds set by containing element)
		

	Splitter Pattern
		- pattern
		- params:
				- direction < h[oriz[ontal]] || v[ert[ical]] >
				- min/max (percentage? of each piece?)
				- gutter size (cover any flourishes with a large gutter?)
				- variable name in object to affect
		- assumes: we just call layout() to resize after setting var
						
		- apply an attribute to an object to make it resizable
		- interaction with layout?  with resizer?

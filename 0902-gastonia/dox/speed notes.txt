speed notes
	- apply is 2x slower than a normal function invocation
	- delay() is VERY slow
	- using even a native iterator function is 2x slower than doing an inline loop
		- prototype's taking over of filter(), etc is a major slowdown on FF2+, Webkit, IE8
	- try/catch seems to be pretty expensive
	
	
startup hogs
	- initializeDependencies
	- includeScript
	- registerThing
	- namespace.insert
	- superize
	- extendUnique
	- firstArgIs$super

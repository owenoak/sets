What are we after?
	- want to put together views with XML and have them just work 
	- want to automatically pull in dependencies
	- want to be able to read/write XML from a front end
	- want to quickly get to the point where we're writing tools in the toll
	- want to be able to build a class by dragging/dropping widgets around & manipulating properties
	- want to have bespin-like editor for editing scripts in the browser (ala hypercard script editor)
	

What do we need?
	- absolutely need to be able to debug user-created JS files normally
	- classes/etc need to be inspectable
	

What do we not know how to do?
	- load/save cycle
	- discover .js missing/load.xml/munge to .js/save .js/load .js cycle
	- draw 1-d containers efficiently
	- draw 2-d grids efficiently
	- draw repeeating structures efficiently
	- add/remove things


Hybrid model
	- class def & JS functions live in Class.js
		+ already working
		+ no compile for this

	- resources best expressed as XML live in Class.resources
		- basic stylesheets
		- templates  (stick into prototype rather than anonymous -- <template id='x' for='Label'/>
		- "children" for setting children automatically

	- documentation for the class lives in Class.dox (as xml)
		- build an editor for this


Drawing
	- we'll have mixed text and children
		- BLARG:  all of our routines can't just loop through children and expect to call a method... :-(
		- teach children to just output strings as text in their stream
	- is there ANY way to do H/VContainer and Grid with using a table???

Open/Save cycle
	- 


XML-based class thing is too wierd
	- noone else will like it
	- adding a lot of overhead for what is essentially only of benefit in docs
	- parsing functions/JS is hard
	
	 BUT
	 	- we will want something like that for the end-user editing,
	 		but maybe we do it a different way later

HOWEVER
	- pulling the children out into XML seems natural and good

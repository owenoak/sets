Form/Control thoughts

* prepareToDraw() has way too many ifs in there
* get draw() a second time working, change redraw() to update()
	- what about when update() needs to hit the server?
* get attach() paradigm working
* we've got an outer element for each control,
	allow that to be a TD in a table


Model/Control split
* don't have getMax() or getLabel() function, just us property
	- otherwise we can't tell if max is dynamic or not
* assume we have a default DataAttribute per field?
	- annoying because field can override, but we can't affect the main one
* on instance init, figure out what is dynamic and what is static
	and set up optimal call paths, otherwise we'll have to do this:

		var max = (typeof this.max == "function" 
					? this.max() 
					: (this.attribute && typeof this.attribute.max == "function" 
						? this.attribute.max(this) 
						: (this.max != undefined 
							? this.max 
							: (this.attribute && typeof this.max ? this.attribute.max)
						  )
					  )
				   );
							
	- better to do this just once when setting up:
		this.max = this.max ? this.max : attribute && attribute.max ? attribute.max : undefined;
		...
		max = (typeof this.max == "function" ? this.max() : this.max);
	
	- can we do this automatically if we know the attributes we're trying to find?

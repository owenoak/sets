Where are we?	Apr 22, 2009

	- 3.5 weeks away from leaving for 4 months w/ who knows how much focus
	- gear6 is getting pretty good but is inconsistent in a number of screens/widget patterns
	- gear6 branch is very advanced in terms of widgets/controller etc
	- still futzing with fundamentals of CF, hope, loading
	- no server presence at this point
	- no doc pattern at this point
	- badly unfocused - still questioning base of system, decision to not use e.g. dojo, etc
	

What would we like to have done by May 15?
	- hope core is super solid
		- loader
		- class factory
		- template system
		- widget creation/embedding
	- control/controller is solid
		- integrate all of gear6 branch control/controller
		- get model/controller stuff working solid
	- operation support is solid
	- refactor all of gear6 onto hope?

- Controls / Controllers / Views


Solid list of todos:
	- get model & control thing working for Gear6
		- get control/schema hookup working
		- convert control to JSON schema
			- label, min()/max(), options, "default", required -> optional
			- 'name' rather than 'id'
		- integrate new draw.js stuff into control
		- convert MS.editor
		- convert MS view
			- visual
			- operations
		- model/view for Memcache screen
	- convert all drawing in Gear6 to Control paradigm
	- make sure all of hope so far works in IE7/8/Safari/FF3+
